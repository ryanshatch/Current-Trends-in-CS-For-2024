<!-- Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and biological neural networks share basic similarities in structure and purpose but differ greatly in complexity and how they operate. Both process input signals and send outputs, but biological neurons use electrochemical signals, while ANNs rely on mathematical functions and weighted inputs (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). Biological neurons are far more intricate, featuring dendrites, axons, and synapses, which ANNs simplify into layers of nodes and adjustable weights (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell, 2013).
On a larger scale, biological networks, with billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, handle parallel processing that supports consciousness and adaptive learning (Seung, 2012). ANNs, although powerful for tasks like image recognition, are smaller in scale and need large data sets and computational power, lacking the general understanding humans have (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015). While humans learn through experiences and reasoning, ANNs stick to algorithmic learning and often require far more data to achieve similar insights (Lake et al., 2017). -->

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and biological neural networks share some core similarities in architecture and function but differ significantly in their complexity and operation. On a single-neuron level, both systems process input signals and pass them to other neurons. Biological neurons use electrochemical signals and neurotransmitters for this process, while ANNs rely on mathematical functions and weighted inputs to generate outputs (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). Structurally, biological neurons are vastly more complex, with dendrites, axons, and synapses that create intricate connections and enable plasticity. ANNs, with their layers of nodes and adjustable weights, aim to mimic this complexity but fall short of replicating the full biological intricacy (Kandel, Schwartz, & Jessell, 2013).

On a network level, both systems aim for pattern recognition and learning, but their scale and adaptability are notably different. Biological neural networks, made up of about 86 billion neurons and trillions of synapses, enable highly parallel processing, supporting functions such as consciousness, emotion, and adaptive learning (Seung, 2012). ANNs, on the other hand, generally have fewer layers and nodes and depend on large data sets and computational power to handle tasks like image and speech recognition. While ANNs can achieve remarkable results in specific areas, they lack the contextual understanding and broad generalization seen in human intelligence (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015).

The learning processes in humans and machines also show major differences. Humans learn through experiences, sensory inputs, and cognitive processes such as reasoning and abstraction, allowing for flexible, continuous learning (Goldberg, 2019). ANNs, however, learn through algorithms—whether supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning—that require extensive training data and often struggle to transfer knowledge across different contexts (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Human learning is highly efficient, capable of generalizing from minimal data, while machine learning needs large data sets and substantial computational resources to reach similar levels of performance (Lake, Ullman, Tenenbaum, & Gershman, 2017).
